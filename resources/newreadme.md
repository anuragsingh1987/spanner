Before we start with GitHub Actions , a brief intro about CI / CD

## **Continuous Integration (CI):**

Definition: Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and integrated into the shared repository on a regular basis. The main goal is to detect and address integration issues early in the development process.


**Key Components:**

* Version Control System (VCS):CI relies on a VCS (e.g., Git) where developers regularly commit code changes.
* Automated Builds:CI systems automatically build the codebase whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
* Automated Testing: Automated tests, including unit tests and integration tests, are run to ensure that the new code changes do not introduce bugs or break existing functionality.
* Continuous Integration Server:CI servers (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions) manage the CI process, orchestrating builds, tests, and integrations.


**Benefits**:

* Early Detection of Issues: CI helps catch integration issues and bugs early in the development process.
* Consistent Builds: Ensures that the codebase can be successfully built in a consistent environment. Faster
* Feedback: Developers receive prompt feedback on the quality and correctness of their code changes.


## **Continuous Deployment (CD):**

**Definition:**
Continuous Deployment (CD) is an extension of CI, where code changes that pass automated tests are automatically deployed to production environments without manual intervention. The goal is to deliver new features and bug fixes quickly and reliably to end-users.


**Key Components:**

* Artifact Repository:Compiled code, configuration files, and other deployment artifacts are stored in a repository for deployment.
* Deployment Automation:Automated scripts or tools are used to deploy the application to different environments (e.g., staging, production).

Rollback Mechanism:CD systems should include a rollback mechanism in case issues arise after deployment.


**Benefits**:

* Rapid Delivery: Enables rapid and reliable delivery of new features and bug fixes.
* Consistency: Ensures consistent deployment processes across different environments.
* Reduced Manual Intervention: Minimizes the need for manual intervention in the deployment process.

## GitHub Actions

Definition: GitHub Actions is a CI/CD and automation service provided by GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows in your GitHub repository, responding to various events and triggers.


**Key Features:**

* **Workflow Files**: Workflows are defined in YAML files and live in the .github/workflows directory.
* **Events and Triggers:**Workflows can be triggered by events such as pushes, pull requests, schedule, and more.
* **Jobs and Steps**:Workflows consist of one or more jobs, each containing a sequence of steps. Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially.
* **Actions:**Actions are reusable units of code that can be used in workflows. GitHub provides a marketplace of actions, and you can create custom actions.

**Benefits**:

* Integrated with GitHub: GitHub Actions is tightly integrated with GitHub repositories.
* Diverse Workflows: Supports a wide range of workflows beyond CI/CD, such as code analysis, release automation, and more.
* Community Contributions: Access to a rich ecosystem of pre-built actions in the GitHub Marketplace.


## Common use cases for GitHub Actions:

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automating the process of building, testing, and validating your code whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
* **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automating the deployment of your application to a staging or production environment when changes are merged into specific branches.
* **Code Quality Checks:** Running linters, code style checks, and other code quality tools to ensure that your codebase adheres to the specified standards.
* **Notification and Communication:** Sending notifications, emails, or messages to specified channels or users based on certain events in your repository.
* **Scheduled Tasks:** Running tasks at scheduled intervals, such as data backups or periodic maintenance.
* **Custom Workflows:** Automating any other custom task that can be defined as a series of steps.

GitHub Actions are highly customizable and flexible, allowing you to create complex workflows tailored to your specific development and deployment needs. The workflows are triggered by events, such as pushes to the repository, pull requests, or the creation of new releases.


## Sample GitHub Actions Workflow


Below is a simple example of a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file. This example workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch, and it runs a series of steps, including checking out the code, installing dependencies, and running tests. This example assumes a Node.js project, but you can customize it based on your specific needs.


```yaml
name: CI

on:
push:
branches:
- main

jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- name: Checkout Repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v2

- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: 14

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: npm install

- name: Run Tests
  run: npm test
```


**Explanation of the workflow:**

* on: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow. In this case, it triggers on every push to the main branch.
* jobs: Defines one or more jobs to be run in parallel. In this example, there's only one job named build. 
* runs-on: Specifies the type of runner (virtual machine) for the job. Here, it's set to ubuntu-latest. 
* steps: Contains a list of tasks to be executed as part of the job. 
* actions/checkout@v2: Checks out the code from the repository. 
* actions/setup-node@v3: Sets up Node.js. 
* npm install: Installs project dependencies. 
* npm test: Runs tests.
